Responsive Design Fix Plan

Problem Analysis:
The inconsistency in elements across different screen sizes is primarily caused by:
1. Fixed Dimensions in Cards: Both `DealCard` and `CompanyCard` widgets have hardcoded widths (e.g., `180.w`) and fixed height constraints. This prevents them from resizing fluidly to fit different grid column widths.
2. Rigid Grid Layouts: Multiple views (`CategoryDealsView`, `ViewAllDealsScreen`, `SearchView`, `CompaniesView`) use `mainAxisExtent` which forces a fixed height for grid items. Combined with the fixed width of the cards, this causes layout gaps or overflows on screens that don't match the design reference exactly.
3. Manual Breakpoints: The logic `width < 360` to switch column counts is too specific and doesn't account for the wide variety of device widths.

Solution Plan:

1. Refactor `DealCard` (lib/app/views/widgets/deal_card.dart):
   - Remove `width: 180.w` from the root Container.
   - Remove `BoxConstraints(minHeight: 220.h, maxHeight: 250.h)`.
   - Allow the widget to fill the constraints provided by its parent.
   - Ensure the image takes up available width (`double.infinity`) and a proportional height or fixed height that works within the aspect ratio.

2. Refactor `CompanyCard` (lib/app/views/widgets/company_card.dart):
   - Remove `width: 180.w` from the root Container.
   - Remove `BoxConstraints(minHeight: 220.h, maxHeight: 245.h)`.
   - Allow the widget to fill the constraints provided by its parent.

3. Update Grid Views:
   - `CategoryDealsView` (lib/app/views/category_deals_view.dart)
   - `ViewAllDealsScreen` (lib/app/views/view_all_deals_screen.dart)
   - `SearchView` (lib/app/views/search_view.dart)
   - `CompaniesView` (lib/app/views/companies_view.dart)

   For each of these views:
   - Remove the `LayoutBuilder` logic that manually toggles column count based on 360px width, unless strictly necessary for very small devices.
   - Instead of `mainAxisExtent`, use `childAspectRatio`.
     - Target Aspect Ratio for Deals: ~0.72 (based on 180/250).
     - Target Aspect Ratio for Companies: ~0.73 (based on 180/245).
   - This ensures that as the screen gets wider (and thus columns get wider), the cards grow in height proportionally, maintaining their design integrity.

4. Verify `DealSection` (lib/app/views/widgets/deal_section.dart):
   - The `DealSection` uses a horizontal ListView. It currently wraps `DealCard` in a `SizedBox(width: 230.w)`.
   - Since `DealCard` will be refactored to be flexible, this `SizedBox` will correctly control the width in the horizontal list. No changes needed here, but verify after `DealCard` changes.

Implementation Steps:

Step 1: Modify `lib/app/views/widgets/deal_card.dart`
- Remove `width` and `constraints` properties from the Container.

Step 2: Modify `lib/app/views/widgets/company_card.dart`
- Remove `width` and `constraints` properties from the Container.

Step 3: Modify `lib/app/views/category_deals_view.dart`
- Update `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`:
  - Remove `mainAxisExtent`.
  - Add `childAspectRatio: 0.7`.

Step 4: Modify `lib/app/views/view_all_deals_screen.dart`
- Update `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`:
  - Remove `mainAxisExtent`.
  - Add `childAspectRatio: 0.7`.

Step 5: Modify `lib/app/views/search_view.dart`
- Update `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`:
  - Remove `mainAxisExtent`.
  - Add `childAspectRatio: 0.7`.

Step 6: Modify `lib/app/views/companies_view.dart`
- Update `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`:
  - Remove `mainAxisExtent`.
  - Add `childAspectRatio: 0.7`.

This approach ensures that the UI scales proportionally on all devices, providing a consistent experience.
